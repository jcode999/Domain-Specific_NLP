The project uses the concept of Context Free Grammar to parse human languages(Natural Languages).
The chat bot is text based, meaning the user will interact with the bot using written text, therefore will not deal with 
[phonems]. 

The project will use context free grammar for Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Understanding, Natural Language Generation. 
NLP : 
- Generate Parse Tree
- gramatical correctness
- Speech Tagging

The NLU and NLG may not be completed before due date, but I will continue to work on the project, as this project alligns with my capstone project. 
The capstone project that I currently am working is a vs-code extention to help visually impaired people code. The extention includes many functionalities such as enlarging font size, changing theme, going to a certain line etc, which helps people with different visual difficulties write code. 
One of the functionality that we are trying to incorporate is voice commands, which allows users to speak commands to access the extention functionalities rather than having to use short-cut keys or to navigate through the menus. 
Our initial approach to this feature was to let user speak very specific commands, convert it into text and run the function that matched to the converted text. 
The problem I see with this is that the user has to speak the exact function name that has been registered. This raises the problem of users having to memorise function names. 

We can use context free grammar to build the langugage that the extention understands. The language of this extention will be a subset of natural english language and is limited within the context of the extention. 
Example, the extention will understand 'Can you run the current program' but will not understand 'Play my favorite music'
